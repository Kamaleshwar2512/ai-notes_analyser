Sample Study Notes - Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Key Concepts:

1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data. Examples include classification and regression problems.

2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm finds hidden patterns in data without any labels. Common techniques include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken.

Types of Machine Learning Algorithms:

- Linear Regression: Used for predicting continuous values
- Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification problems
- Decision Trees: Tree-like models for classification and regression
- Random Forest: Ensemble method using multiple decision trees
- Support Vector Machines: Effective for classification with clear margins
- Neural Networks: Deep learning models inspired by biological neurons

Applications of Machine Learning:

Machine learning is used in various fields including:
- Healthcare: Disease diagnosis and drug discovery
- Finance: Fraud detection and risk assessment
- Transportation: Self-driving cars and route optimization
- Marketing: Customer segmentation and recommendation systems
- Entertainment: Content recommendation and gaming AI

The future of machine learning looks promising with advancements in deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision technologies.
